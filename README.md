# Normalizing Flows
In this repository, I've implemented various normalizing flow models - a model whose goal is to map complex data distributions to simple ones. I started with the implementation of a basic **1D normalizing flow model** that transforms a one-dimensional, unknown data distribution into a simple prior distribution, such as beta or uniform. Upon this, I built **2D normalizing flow model** by extending the concept to 2 dimensions using autoregression, a technique that sequentially transforms each dimension of the input random variable. Then I generalized to the **NICE model** ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516)), a **multidimensional normalizing flow model** that transforms multiple dimensions simultaneously by using a clever coupling layer concept.
